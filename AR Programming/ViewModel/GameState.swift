/// This class is used to package the various objects that need to be shared between all the controllers that make up the game view.
///
/// The logic for surface detection, displaying the level, scanning the card sequence, and showing card details has been divided among various controllers. As such, they have a need to share state with each other. By passing around an instance of this class, they can share this information through dependency injection.
