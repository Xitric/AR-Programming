/// A wrapper allowing clients to observe changes to a value. This is similar to the concept of binding from MVVM.
///
/// Observers are registered in the form of closures that will be called whenever the wrapped value is changed. Since these closures are likely not retained by the client that created them, they can be removed from this property using an Observer object returned from the two observe() methods.
///
/// Furthermore, a property will capture all of its observers strongly. Thus, a client is responsible for releasing its observers on a property before it is deallocated to avoid memory leaks. This is only important if the property can outlive the client, since once the property is deallocated, all its observing closures will be deallocated as well. Failing to release an observer should not result in a retain cycle.
///
/// To avoid a retain cycle, all registered observers should not capture their client object strongly, unless the client object only captures this property weakly or not at all.
///
/// A property will not retain itself just because it has active observers. As such, to prevent the property from being deallocated, it should be retained strongly by a client object.
