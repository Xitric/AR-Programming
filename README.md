Source code accompanying the Bachelor's thesis "_Multi-user tangible programming with augmented reality_". Written by Emil Nielsen and Kasper Schultz Davidsen, the University of Southern Denmark, spring 2019.

## Idea
This project concerns the development of an augmented reality app for teaching simple algorithms and programming to children. The app will make use of tangible programming cards tagged with Aztec codes. This allows for easy identification using the camera on tablets and smartphones.

The user can create program sequences by laying out the cards in different orders on a flat surface. The cards contain no microchips and are thus controlled entirely through the app. The goal is to program a virtual robot to solve simple tasks. The functionality of the cards can range from simple operations such as moving and rotating to more complex constructs such as branches and loops.
