## Idea
This is an augmented reality app that allows the user to program a virtual robot by using up to 6 programming cards. Each card is assigned a functionality depending on the exercise that the user is currently trying to solve.

To construct a program sequence, the user lays out a number of cards on a flat surface. The app will use the camera on the iOS device to identify this sequence of cards. The app then executes the program on a robot that will be projected onto the same surface.
